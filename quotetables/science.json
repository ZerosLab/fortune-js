It's something like this: Formerly the sea was fresh water and\nsalt was rare and expensive.  A miller received from a wizard a wonderful\nmachine that just ground salt out of itself all day long.  At first the miller\nthought himself the most fortunate man in the world, but soon all the villages\nhad salt to last them for centuries and still the machine kept on grinding\nmore salt.  The miller had to move out of his house, he had to move off his\nacres.  At last he determined that he would sink the machine in the sea and\nbe rid of it.  But the mill ground so fast that boat and miller and machine\nwere sunk together, and down below, the mill still went on grinding and that's\nwhy the sea is salt.\n	I don't get you, said the assistant.\n		-- Guy Endore, Men of Iron", "White dwarf seeks red giant for binary relationship.", "Why do mathematicians insist on using words that already have another\nmeaning?
