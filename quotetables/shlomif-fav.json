It's a trojan, which was put there\nby the NSA in order to infiltrate the CIA mainframe. The Debian package\nmaintainer noticed this and uploaded that version of the package to non-free\ninstead of main, since the trojan code does not come with proper source.\n\n* Upstream has moved the RSS feed for new releases without notifying the old\nfeed of the move, so the Debian package maintainer missed that, and doesn't\nactually know about the new release. Due to a complicated series of\nhappenstance involving rainbows, midget unicorns, and the ongoing rewrite of\nthe Netsurf web browser, the Debian package maintainer is not able to find the\nnew feed because it would require doing a web search and their browser doesn't\nhave working form support now. No other browser is available on the Amiga\nthey're using as their only computer, either.\n\n* The new release is requested by insistent Hurd porters, and the Debian\npackage maintainer absolutely loathes the Hurd, and will refuse to upload any\npackages that work on the Hurd.\n\n* The Debian package maintainer suffers from mental problems cause by reading\ndebian-devel too much, and now has a nervous breakdown every time they\nrecognize a name as someone whom they've seen on the list.\n\n* The Debian development process is being sabotaged by Microsoft sending\npeople to the developers' houses pretending to be TV license checkers or\nJehova's witnesses every time they detect, using the hardware wireless\nkeylogger embedded in every PC, that the developer is trying to run any Debian\npackaging command.\n\n* Apple is also sabotaging Debian by paying me to write snarky e-mails on\nDebian mailing lists to distract everyone from working on the actual release,\nso that we can get past the freeze and start uploading things again without\nhaving to worry that it breaks things in ways that makes the freeze longer.\n\n    -- Lars Wirzenius\n    -- Post to debian-devel ( lwn.net/Articles/509254/ )", "Some European users bugged me into adding an option to limit the number of\nmessages retrieved per session (so they can control costs from their expensive\nphone networks).
