["A fellow bought a new car, a Nissan, and was quite happy with his purchase.\nHe was something of an animist, however, and felt that the car really ought\nto have a name.  This presented a problem, as he was not sure if the name\nshould be masculine or feminine.\n	After considerable thought, he settled on an naming the car either\nBelchazar or Beaumadine, but remained in a quandry about the final choice.\n	Is a Nissan male or female? he began asking his friends.  Most of\nthem looked at him peculiarly, mumbled things about urgent appointments, and\nwent on their way rather quickly.\n	He finally broached the question to a lady he knew who held a black\nbelt in judo.  She thought for a moment and answered Feminine.\n	The swiftness of her response puzzled him. You're sure of that? he\nasked.\n	Certainly, she replied. They wouldn't sell very well if they were\nmasculine.\n	Unhhh...  Well, why not?\n	Because people want a car with a reputation for going when you want\nit to.  And, if Nissan's are female, it's like they say...  `Each Nissan, she\ngo!'\n\n	[No, we WON'T explain it; go ask someone who practices an oriental\n	martial art.
