This happened about thirty years ago to the son of a Rumanian\ngentleman who was owed a personal favour by Georges Enesco, the celebrated\nviolinist.  Enesco agreed to give lessons to the son who was quite\nunhampered by great musical talent.\n	Three years later the boy's father insisted that he give a public\nconcert.  His aunt said that nobody plays the violin better than he does.\nA cousin heard him the other day and screamed with enthusiasm.  Although\nEnesco feared the consequences, he arranged a recital at the Salle Gaveau\nin Paris.  However, nobody bought a ticket since the soloist was unknown.\n	Then you must accompany him on the piano, said the boy's father,\nand it will be a sell out.\n	Reluctantly, Enesco agreed and it was.  On the night an excited\naudience gathered.  Before the concert began Enesco became nervous and\nasked for someone to turn his pages.\n	In the audience was Alfred Cortot, the brilliant pianist, who\nvolunteered and made his way to the stage.\n	The soloist was of uniformly low standard and next morning the\nmusic critic of Le Figaro wrote: There was a strange concert at the Salle\nGaveau last night.  The man whom we adore when he plays the violin played\nthe piano.  Another whom we adore when he plays the piano turned the pages.\nBut the man who should have turned the pages played the violin.\n		-- Stephen Pile, The Book of Heroic Failures", "There are three reasons for becoming a writer: the first is that you need\nthe money; the second that you have something to say that you think the\nworld should know; the third is that you can't think what to do with the\nlong winter evenings.\n		-- Quentin Crisp", "There are three rules for writing a novel.

Unfortunately, one of them is\nstruck by a truck and killed.  About a week later his friend wakes up in\nthe middle of the night with a start because he can feel a presence in the\nroom.  He calls out, Who's there?  Who's there?  What's going on?\n	It's me -- Bob, replies a faraway voice.\n	Excitedly he sits up in bed.  Bob!  Bob!  Is that you?  Where are\nyou?\n	Well, says the voice, I'm in heaven now.\n	Heaven!  You're in heaven!  That's wonderful!  What's it like?\n	It's great, man.

It begins with the vision to\nrecognize when a job, a life stage, a relationship is over -- and to let\ngo.  It means leaving what's over without denying its validity or its\npast importance in our lives.  It involves a sense of future, a belief\nthat every exit line is an entry, that we are moving on, rather than out.\nThe trick of retiring well may be the trick of living well.  It's hard to\nrecognize that life isn't a holding action, but a process.  It's hard to\nlearn that we don't leave the best parts of ourselves behind, back in the\ndugout or the office. We own what we learned back there.  The experiences\nand the growth are grafted onto our lives.  And when we exit, we can take\nourselves along -- quite gracefully.\n		-- Ellen Goodman", "There's nothing remarkable about it.

Certain bodies can pass through solid walls painted to resemble tunnel\n      entrances; others cannot.\n	This trompe l'oeil inconsistency has baffled generations, but at least\n	it is known that whoever paints an entrance on a wall's surface to\n	trick an opponent will be unable to pursue him into this theoretical\n	space.
