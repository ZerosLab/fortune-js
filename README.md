# fortune-js
fortune-mod, but in javascript. kinda. its not as robust and its kinda bodged together but its my baby so youre not allowed to insult it




## fortune.js
basically the file picks a random number and then picks from an array and writes the result to an html element. you can change the elementid to whatever id you want to use
the quotepath variable is the path to the quotes file. ill address those in a moment. it can be relative or absolute.

### quote files
im working on making the format fortune-mod uses work with this version. however, at the moment, it doesnt. txttojson.py is an attempt at a script to convert from the plaintext fortunemod uses to the array that the js uses. **it is currently broken. do not expect txttojson to make a quote file functional**


To see this project at work, check out my {development page}(https://zeroslab.github.io/fortune-js/test.html)! its quite volatile.
